            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <p class="first">Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide
                Web)
                or an
                intranet (a
                private network).</p>
            <p>
                Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
                sites:
                writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content
                changes
                easier and available with basic technical skills.
            </p>
            <p>Since the commercialization of the Web, Web development has been a growing industry. The growth of this
                industry
                is being driven by businesses wishing to use their Web site to advertise and sell products and services
                to
                customers.</p>
